# RC4-Cross-Platform
A simple and consistent RC4 encryption implementation for both C++ and C#.

# Overview
This project provides a lightweight, cross-compatible RC4 encryption implementation designed to work seamlessly across C++ and C#. It eliminates the inconsistencies often encountered when using different RC4 implementations in different programming languages.

# Why Use This?
In many cross-platform or cross-language applications, ensuring consistent encryption and decryption results across languages can be challenging. This implementation is designed to produce identical outputs in both C++ and C#, making it ideal for secure communication between systems written in either language.

# Use Case
Perfect for scenarios where encrypted communication is required between a C++ application and a C# application. With this shared RC4 implementation, you can confidently exchange encrypted data across platforms without worrying about discrepancies in the algorithmâ€™s behavior.

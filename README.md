# RC4-Cross-Platform
An easy RC4 C++/C# compatible implementation for both programming languages.

# What does it mean ?
Well, a lot of times I've had issues with various types of algorithms of RC4 encryption to be different on different languages.
This is an easy and clean implementation of RC4 working on both programming language and being same

# And?
You can communicate between C++ and C# with this RC4 encryption
